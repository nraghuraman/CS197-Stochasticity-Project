# CS197-Stochasticity-Project
This was a research project I completed with Eric Lou and Leo Jean-Baptiste of Stanford University for the Stanford Course Computer Science Research. It involved the testing of a technique for making neural networks robust against adversarial inputs called a Barrage of Random Transforms.

This repository contains code for the training and testing of our neural networks against adversarial examples. To see the code we utilized to generate adversarial examples, visit https://github.com/ezl-13/advex-uar, which is a fork of the original Advex-UAR code developed by Daniel Kang, et al. for the research paper "Testing Robustness Against Unforeseen Adversaries."
